Edge-Kempe classes in plane regular graphs
==========================================

This repository gives an overview of different scripts and their results used to
obtain the computational results from the paper _Edge-Kempe classes in plane
regular graphs_.

The scripts in this repository make extensive use of programs from different
other repositories:

* [planegraph_library](https://github.com/nvcleemp/planegraph_library)
* [perfectly_hamiltonian](https://github.com/nvcleemp/perfectly_hamiltonian)
* [graphtools](https://github.com/nvcleemp/graphtools)
* [plantri](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/plantri/): we just need the main
  program `plantri`

In order to run the scripts in this repository you need to compile the programs
from these sources and add their location to the PATH variable.

Several of the scripts also use the lists of quintic plane graphs available at
[http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/planegraphs.html](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/planegraphs.html)
as an input.

Structure
---------

Below we give an overview of the contents of each of the folders in this
repository.

### counting

This folder groups several scripts that are concerned with counting the number
of Kempe classes (i.e. equivalence classes for edge-colourings of regular graphs
generated by the edge-Kempe switch operation and the corresponding equivalence
relation). This folder contains subfolders for the separate degrees of the 
regular graphs: cubic, quartic, and quintic. Each of the separate folders
contains a README document with additional information.

* [The cubic case](counting/cubic/README.md)
* [The quartic case](counting/quartic/README.md)
* [The quintic case](counting/quintic/README.md)

### single_switches

This folder contains the scripts needed to explore the possible effect of a
single Kempe switch. See the README document in this folder for more details.

Formats
-------

All files with the extension `plc` are in the planarcode file format. This is a binary code encoding an embedded graph. Details about this format can be found in the user manual of [plantri](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/plantri/).
